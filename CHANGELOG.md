# Current

TODO

# 0.13.6

- Attempt to overcome `ValueError: {'message': 'Internal JSON-RPC error.', 'code': -32603}` if served by a Pokt relat

# 0.13.5

- `has_graphql_support` made more robust

# 0.13.4

- Retry middleware fine tuning

# 0.13.3

- Off by one fix in read_events_concurrent max block range
- More event reader test coverage

# 0.13.2

- Better test and exception coverage if bad `extract_timestamps`
  is passed while reading events. This prevents the library
  user to write a bad timestamp provider function.

# 0.13.1

- Fix `filter` and `event` assert in `read_events_concurrent()` 

# 0.13

- Fix: Duplicate events appearing when using the concurrent event reader
- Added `ReorganisationMonitor` and `ChainReorganisationDetected` to deal with unstable chain tips when
  doing event ignestion
- Added `uniswap-v2-pairs-swap-live.py` example that shows real-time
  swaps happening on QuickSwap (Polygon) in a terminal
- Add `has_graphql_support()` to detect GraphQL interface on GoEthereum
- Add `GraphQLReorganisationMonitor` for very fast downloading
  of block headers and timestamps using GoEthereum /graphql API 

# 0.12

- Added `generate_fake_uniswap_v2_data()` to generate synthetic Uniswap v2 trade feeds
- Improved `PairDetails` API, added `get_current_mid_price()`
- Add `PairDetails.checksum_free_address` to shortcut getting lowercased Ethereum address
- Added `convert_jsonrpc_value_to_int()` to deal differences between real JSON-RPC and EthereumTester
- Add `install_chain_middleware()` and `install_retry_middleware()`
- Add `measure_block_time()`
- Add multiple contract address filtering to the event reader
- Add `fetch_deployment` for Uniswap v3
- Add `swap_with_slippage_protection` for Uniswap v3


# 0.11.3

- Add new PriceOracle types for unit testing

# 0.11.2

- Adding Trader Joe compatibility. Unlike other clones, Trader Joe uses `Router.WAVAX` instead `Roueter.WETH`
  for the native token variable.
- Document BNB Chain "Limits exceeded" error - BNB Chain eth_getLogs have been 
  disabled on public endpoints
