    We attempt to build a list of token holdings by analysing incoming ERC-20 Transfer events to a wallet.

    The blockchain native currency like `ETH` or `MATIC` is not included in the analysis, because native
    currency transfers do not generate events.

    We are not doing any throttling: If you ask for too many events once this function and your
    Ethereum node are likely to blow up.

    .. note ::

        Because the limitations of GoEthereum, this method is likely to fail on public
        JSON-RPC nodes for blockchains like Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and others.
        E.g. BSC nodes will fail with `{'code': -32000, 'message': 'exceed maximum block range: 5000'}`.
        Even if the nodes don't directly fail, their JSON-RPC APIs are likely to timeout.
