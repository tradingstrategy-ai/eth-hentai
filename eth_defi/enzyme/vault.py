    """Enzyme vault wrapper.

    - Vaults are Enzyme Protocol "funds" where you have investors and assets

    - Investors have ownership of vault assets with a share token

    - Each vault has its denomiation asset, e.g. USDC that you use for the buy in

    - You buy-in to a vault using `buyShares`

    - Redemption is "in-kind" and you swap your share tokens to the tokens
      of underlying open positions and other assets

    - A separate vault owner (fund owner) can make the vault to perform trades

    Vault in Enzyme are presented by two smart contracts

    - Vault contract

    - Comptroller contract

    - `See Enzyme documentation for general information about vaults <https://docs.enzyme.finance/managers/setup/fund-basics>`__.

    - `See Enzyme spec for technical information about vaults <https://specs.enzyme.finance/>`__.
