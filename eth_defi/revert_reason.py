    """Gets a transaction revert reason.

    Ethereum nodes do not store the transaction failure reason in any database or index.

    There is two ways to get the revert reason

    - Replay the transaction against the same block, and the same EVM state, where it was mined. An archive node is needed.

    - Replay the transaction against the current state. No archive node is needed, but the revert reason might be wrong.

    To make this work

    - Live node must have had enough archive state for the replay to success (full nodes store only 128 blocks by default)

    - Ganache must have been started with `block_time >= 1` so that transactions do not revert on transaction broadcast

    - When sending transsaction using `web3.eth.send_transaction` it must have `gas` set, or the transaction
      will revert during the gas estimation

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

        receipts = wait_transactions_to_complete(web3, [tx_hash])

        # Check that the transaction reverted
        assert len(receipts) == 1
        receipt = receipts[tx_hash]
        assert receipt.status == 0

        reason = fetch_transaction_revert_reason(web3, tx_hash)
        assert reason == "VM Exception while processing transaction: revert BEP20: transfer amount exceeds balance"

    .. note ::

        `use_archive_node=True` path cannot be tested in unit testing.

    Different JSON-RPC providers may return payloads and this function
    needs to handle each provider as a special case. See `manual_bnb_chain_check_revert_reason.py`
    for testing. Currently tested:

    - Ethereum Tester

    - Ganache

    - BNB Chain + geth

    :param web3: Our JSON-RPC connection

    :param tx_hash: Transaction hash of which reason we extract by simulation.

    :param use_archive_node:
        Look up *exact* reason by running the tx against the past state.
        This only works if you are connected to the archive node.

    :param unknown_error_message:
        Return this message if the revert reason extraction fails.
        Check the logs for details and pointers.

    :return: The revert reason of the placeholder message if we could not extract the reason somehow.
